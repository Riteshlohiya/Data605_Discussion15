# Exercise 12.3 Problem 6

Evaluate $f_x(x, y) and f_y(x, y)$ at the indicated point.

$f(x, y) = x^3 -3x + y^2$ $at (-1,3)$

$\frac{df}{dx}=3x^2 - 3$

$f_x(-1,3) = 3(-1)^2 - 3 = 0$

$\frac{df}{dy}=2y - 6$

$f_y(-1,3) = 2(3) - 6 = 0$

#Most valuable elements you took away from this course:

After a long time i came in touch with the real mathematics again especially calculus and learned new concepts such as LU decomposition and many new R concepts which i was not aware. This will really help me in my data science journey especially in machine learning and deep learning.
